## How it works

### Minting

In this project, when user generate thier token, Javascript on browser will generate svg string base on Flow Field pathfinding algorithm then upload it to IPFS. After that, the IPFS url will be use for mint the token via contract on Zilliqa chain. As soon as the transaction complete, the image will be show on the interface.

### Gallery exhibition

In this section, we use `@zilliqa-js/zilliqa` module to retrieve the contract state. We filter all token url with user's address from ZillPay wallet and then show it on screen.
